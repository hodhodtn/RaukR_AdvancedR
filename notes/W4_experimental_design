1. Avoid oversampling area of interest
	* randomise
	* latin square
	* do not run all your controls on 1 chip
	* systematic sampling for non-sampled areas


2. Control treatments in different batches


3. Define your population and get an idea of its params (stratification)
	* random effects
	* pca


4. Selection bias
	* randomise
	* match cases-controls
